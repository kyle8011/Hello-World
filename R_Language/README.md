# Overview

I felt that learning a new coding language for data analysis like R would be helpful for any projects that require the manipulation of data into graphs and other visuals.

This software reads from a csv file containing videogame sale data and extracts several pieces of information like total number of sales per country, different genres, and different companies. It makes comparisons in the form of a bar graph and a pie graph.

I wrote this software to understand how R language facilitates the manipulation of data and how it makes the presentation of data easier.

# Development Environment

I used R language via the extension in VS Code. This language is similar to both python and c++, it has similar syntax examples of both. Brackets are used like c++ but loop parameters and print statements are more similar to python. One big difference is when defining variables <- is used instead of an =.

I didn't specifically include any libraries, but R already has tons of functions built in that take care of making dataframes, graphs, vectors, lists, and handling complex numbers.

# Future Work

- Using different types of graphs.
- Automating things in functions so different columns can be chosen.
- Making more comparisons.
