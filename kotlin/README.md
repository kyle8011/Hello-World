# Overview

In order to further my learning I decided to learn kotlin because it is widely used for creating apps on Android.
This will be helpful in understanding how applications are created and run, and also how java works.

This software has a test function that covers different aspects of kotlin, as well as user input. It creates objects
from a class (Person) that has several different methods dealing with location, and one for introductions.

This piece of software demonstrates usage of the Kotlin language. It covers data types, mutable vs immutable,
expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and classes. It also demonstrates use of the 'when' keyword.

# Development Environment

I used the IntelliJ idea IDE along with the OpenJDK from Oracle to 
create this software. This allows auto-completion and suggestions for kotlin.

The kotlin language syntax is the same as java, which is very similar to python.
There are just a few differences such as data type descriptions. I used the random and math libraries from java and kotlin
to help with randomizing movement and distance calculations.
