# Overview

As an electrical engineer I am planning on working with embedded systems that incorporate both hardware and software. Examples of this include cars, microwaves, refrigerators, cell phones, anything that requires the use of a microcontroller to function.

This program uses a library in python that takes data in the form of a string and sends it to the output terminal. It also includes the colorama library to change the color of the output.

The purpose of this software is to print "Hello Wolrd" on the screen and learn about libraries in python.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used the print function and the colorama library to change the color and print the output to the terminal.

This software was written in python which is mainly used as a testing language because it runs changes in code very quickly (due to it not creating an exe file every time).
