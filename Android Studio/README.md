# Overview

As an electrical engineer I would like to be aware of the different types of software tools that are out there.
Cell phones are very common and it would be a good thing to understand better how they work. For this reason
I chose to learn how to create an android app using android studio.

I made two different applications, one to test out the functionality of switching pages and reacting to button presses,
and the other one to make a simple arcade game (tic tac toe) that saves data while the app is not active.

I created these apps in order to learn more about how android studio works, and to have a fun demonstration to show others.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio with the JetBrains IDE. This allows the implementation of many libraries and checking
to see if there are any typos. For me, Android Studio had a steep learning curve as far as including the
correct libraries and resolving code issues. I was able to use the Logcat terminal to learn about these issues.

I used the kotlin programming language along with the appCompatActivity, widget.Button, Binding, Toast,
and sharedPreferences libraries. These libraries make it possible to have buttons that interact with the
user's touch on the screen to receive information and print it back to the screen. The sharedPreferences
made it possible to save date in between closing and opening the app again.

# Future Work

* Make the game more unique and interesting by adding different messages, changing colors, and perhaps an AI.
* Add more pages with different games, set up a main menu to choose between the different games.
* Change the layout of the page to be more inviting and refined.
