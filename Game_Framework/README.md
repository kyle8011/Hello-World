# Overview

My purpose in writing this software was to learn how to use Unity, how to write scripts, and how to connect them. I also learned how to use SQL databases in c#.

This game is a 2D platformer. The objective is to collect all of the kiwis and make it to the finish line. If you hit any spikes or saws you will restart the level. Use the left and right arrow keys to move and spacebar to jump.

I only uploaded the scripts here because all of the unity files include about 3000 files and I didn't want to upload that to github, but you can take a look at the different C# scripts that I made. Check out the video to see what the actual game looks like.

# Development Environment

The tools I used to develop this software incluse Unity, SQLite, and C# scripts. Unity is a software made for creating games. It allows the user to create objects and place them on a visible coordinate system. Unity allows you to connect scripts to any objects created that define how the object should act or interract with other objects.

C# is a variation of c that is very geared toward classes and objects. In order to make a C# file the programmer has to use a namespace and a class. Semicolons come after each line of code. I used the SQLite library that allows the programmer to make databases and read from them.
